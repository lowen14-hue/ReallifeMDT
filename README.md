        <h3>Logline</h3>
        <p>
            A boxer is living his dream life when he glitches to a post-nuclear dystopian reality 
            where everyone is wearing helmets. He must do everything in his power to wake the 
            other Walkers.
        </p>

        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>
            CHAZ is a world-renowned professional boxer with a beautiful wife, CARA, two children—
            LAYLA and ASHER—along with a mansion and sports car. After a major fight, the family 
            decides to take a vacation to Hawai‘i. On his private jet, Chaz briefly sees a dystopian 
            world where people march in a Saint John’s Arm command formation wearing DAFT PUNK-style helmets. 
            He continues glitching between his dream life and this strange reality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, he stabilizes inside the dystopia. He wakes three others—ZELMIRA, CLEOPATRA, 
            and APERIO—who, like him, have been trapped inside dream worlds projected through their helmets. 
            The four endure “The Gauntlet,” a continuous march under drone surveillance while trying to 
            understand what is real.
        </p>

        <p>
            They attempt to rally other Walkers, but time runs short. Forced to act alone, the group 
            launches an assault against the governing body. Their battle leads Chaz and Zel face-to-face 
            with the President, who claims the government created the helmet system to save humanity 
            after a devastating nuclear war.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overwhelmed, Chaz rejects the explanation, kills the President, and then kills Zel. He returns 
            to his barrack where visions of his family fill his mind. As he reaches toward his helmet—
            BUZZER. We reveal an older, out-of-shape Chaz rising from a chair in a mall “Helmet Shop.”

        <h3>The Collective Pseudonym: <strong>Matt DeTito</strong></h3>
        <p>
            “Matt DeTito” is a combination of all our names—symbolizing equal contribution, 
            shared ownership, and a unified creative voice. This project exists because each 
            member shaped it with ideas, passion, and dedication.
        </p>

        <h3>Anthony Matarazzo</h3>
        <p>
            Anthony (the “Matt” in DeTito) was born and raised in Southington, CT. He enjoys 
            spending time with family and friends, and loves sports—with favorite teams including 
            the Dallas Cowboys, Boston Celtics, and Boston Red Sox. His favorite movie is 
            <em>Rocky IV</em>, and he has a passion for music, especially producer Avicii.
        </p>

        <h3>Rowan Devlin</h3>
        <p>
            Rowan (the “De” in DeTito) grew up in Newton, MA. A middle child in a big Irish 
            household, he was raised around his family’s Boston restaurants. Rowan is a lover 
            of all genres of film and music, especially works like <em>Snatch</em>, 
            <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, and <em>Good Will Hunting</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Owen Lotito</h3>
        <p>
            Owen (the “Tito” in DeTito) was born and raised in Wrentham, MA. He enjoys golfing, 
            3D design, and spending time with loved ones. He grew up playing soccer and lacrosse 
            and is a fan of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series.
        </p>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            REALLIFE was born during a night of music, laughter, and curiosity. A deep dive into 
            Daft Punk’s album <em>Random Access Memories</em> sparked the idea: 
            "What if through their helmets, you could see your dream world?"  
            From this moment came months of development, rewriting, and world-building to create 
            a story exploring technology addiction, global conflict, and the blurred line between 
            reality and illusion.
