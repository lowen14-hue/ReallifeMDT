    <h2>Logline</h2>
    <p>A boxer is living his dream life when he glitches into a post-nuclear dystopian reality
    where everyone wears helmets. He must do everything in his power to wake the other Walkers.</p>

    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Chaz, a world-renowned boxer, lives a perfect life with his family. During a flight to Hawai'i,
    he begins glitching into a dystopian world where people march in formation wearing reflective
    helmets that project dream worlds into their minds.</p>

    <p>He awakens three others trapped in this system and together they uncover the truth, survive
    “The Gauntlet,” and attempt to overthrow the power controlling their minds.</p>

    <p>Their rebellion leads to a final confrontation with the President, who insists the helmet system
    is the only way to save humanity after a nuclear war. Overwhelmed, Chaz kills her — and then his
    last remaining ally.</p>

    <p>As he reaches toward his helmet… BUZZER. An older, exhausted Chaz stands up in a mall Helmet Shop.
    What was real…?</p>
