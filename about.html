    <h2>About the Authors</h2>
    <p><strong>Matt DeTito</strong> is a pseudonym representing the collaborative work of <strong>Anthony Matarazzo</strong>, <strong>Owen Lotito</strong>, and <strong>Rowen Devlin</strong> (Matt = Matarazzo, De = Devlin, Tito = Lotito). Together, they created <em>REALLIFE</em>, blending dystopian sci-fi, dream logic, and emotional conflict.</p>
    <p>The authors explore identity, perception, and the fragility of consciousness through Chaz’s journey between realities. Their collaborative style fuses cinematic action with psychological depth.</p>

    <h2>Writing Process</h2>
    <p>The authors lived together in college and conceived the idea for REALLIFE one night over dinner, immediately beginning to brainstorm. They drafted a rough draft of the screenplay and have been iterating on it ever since. During their process, they met with famous authors, including <strong>Jeff Kinney</strong> (author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series), who provided insight into the industry and guidance on formatting their script to align with the teachings of the <em>Save the Cat</em> book.</p>

    <h2>Character Bios</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chaz:</strong> A world-renowned boxer who navigates between a dream life and a dystopian world, struggling to wake the Walkers.</li>
        <li><strong>The Walkers:</strong> Humans trapped in the helmet system, unaware of the real world.</li>
        <li><strong>The President:</strong> Claims to protect humanity post-nuclear war, becomes the final antagonist.</li>
        <li><strong>Allies:</strong> The three other awakened individuals who join Chaz in uncovering the truth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Glossary / Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Walkers:</strong> Humans trapped in the helmet system, unaware of reality, moving in formation like automatons.</li>
        <li><strong>Helmet System:</strong> Technology that projects dream worlds into the minds of those connected, controlling perception and behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>The Gauntlet:</strong> A deadly trial the protagonists must survive in the dystopian world.</li>
        <li><strong>President:</strong> The authoritarian figure claiming to protect humanity after nuclear war.</li>
        <li><strong>Dream Life:</strong> Chaz’s idealized, personal reality that contrasts with the dystopia.</li>
        <li><strong>Awakened:</strong> Individuals who have broken free of the Helmet System and perceive true reality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reality vs. illusion</li>
        <li>Identity and self-perception</li>
        <li>Power, control, and rebellion</li>
        <li>The human cost of technological systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Worldbuilding</h2>
    <p>The story takes place across two main realities: Chaz’s idealized dream life and a post-nuclear dystopian world where humans are enslaved to helmet systems showing dreamscapes. The dystopia is structured, regimented, and controlled, contrasting the fluidity of dreams.</p>

    <h2>Author’s Notes</h2>
    <p>We wanted to explore what it feels like to question reality itself, and how personal identity survives in extreme circumstances. Chaz’s journey reflects both internal and external struggles, balancing action with introspection.</p>

    <h2>Inspirations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dystopian sci-fi classics (e.g., “1984,” “Brave New World”)</li>
        <li>Psychological thrillers exploring dreams and consciousness</li>
        <li>Martial arts and boxing films for action choreography</li>
        <li>Experimental cinema blending reality and hallucination</li>
    </ul>
